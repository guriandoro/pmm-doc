# Docker (Client)

If [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on a client, you can avoid installing the PMM Client package and run all of PMM's client tools and programs (exporters, agents, command-line tools) via our [PMM Client Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/pmm-client/tags/).

## Running PMM Client as a Docker container

1. Pull the image:

	```sh
    docker pull percona/pmm-client:2
	```

2. Create a persistent data store based on the same image. This preserves local data when you pull an updated image:

	```sh
    docker create -v /srv --name pmm-client-data percona/pmm-client:2 /bin/true
	```

3. Run the container to start the PMM Agent in setup mode:

	```sh
    docker run --rm \
    -e PMM_AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=pmm-server-IP-address:443 \
    -e PMM_AGENT_SERVER_USERNAME=admin \
    -e PMM_AGENT_SERVER_PASSWORD=admin \
    -e PMM_AGENT_SERVER_INSECURE_TLS=1 \
    -e PMM_AGENT_SETUP=1 \
    -e PMM_AGENT_CONFIG_FILE=pmm-agent.yml \
    --volumes-from pmm-client-data percona/pmm-client:2
	```

## Connecting to a Docker PMM Server by container name

To connect to a Dockerized PMM Server by name instead of IP:

1. Put both containers on a non-default network:

	1. Create a network:

		```sh
		docker network create <network-name>
		```

	2. Connect a container to that network:

		```sh
		docker network connect <network-name> <container>
		```

2. Change the value of the first option to `-e PMM_AGENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=your-pmm-server-container-name:443`.
